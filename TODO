TODO file for Workflow

$Id: TODO 340 2007-09-25 20:58:06Z jonasbn $

- Document general workflow initialization phase and the call to the
  Workflow classes init method in a more general way

- Document relation between actions and validators

- Add test of validate in Workflow::Validator::MatchesDateFormat

- Investigate if either Workflow::Validator::InEnumeratedType or
  Workflow::Validator::MatchesDateFormat are violation an (undefined) abstract 
  class. One holds a validate method the other a validator method.

- Add test of validator in Workflow::Validator::InEnumeratedType

- Implement handling of forgotten filename parameter to parse in
  Workflow::Config::Perl, this might have to propagate to Workflow::Config::XML
  also

- Add support for string based configuration instead of file based (copying
  behavior from XML::Simple) ?

- Write more POD, including a tutorial

- Write more tests (we need better coverage)

- Deal with whatever is in the RT queue

    - Workflow::Factory sub-classing reported by Andrew (RT #18159)
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18159

    - Enabling of dynamic loading of config, patch from Andrew (RT #18265)
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18265
      
- Examine and apply received patches

From TODO.txt:

- Where to put the configuration for the built-in
validators/conditions/actions? Should we make it part of the
WorkflowFactory initialization process, maybe just keep the built-ins
configured in a class that's distributed with the module? (We don't
want to force people to reference a separate file every time...

- Make the action/description of initial history created configurable
(optional?)
