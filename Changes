Revision history for Perl extension Workflow

0.03  Mon May 24 19:16:40 EDT 2004

      * Applied modified patches from Jim Smith (jgsmith@tamu.edu) to
        do the following:

      - Allow you to read in the XML/Perl configuration file from
      somewhere else and pass it to Workflow::Config as a scalar
      reference.

      - You can subclass Workflow::Factory and still use 'FACTORY' to
      import the factory of the class you want and 'instance()' to do
      the same.

      * Added docs for these new features, and added tests for at
        least the factory subclassing feature.
