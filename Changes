Revision history for Perl extension Workflow

  eg (example application):

      - Add CGI interface ('ticket.cgi') to example application, and
      move most of the logic into App::Web, which is now a full object
      instead of a bunch of class methods. Both the standalone web
      server ('ticket_web.pl') and the CGI script use the same logic,
      templates, template processing, etc.

  Workflow::Config

      - Move Perl/XML configuration parsers to separate classes and
      make this class a factory.

      - Add class method 'parse_all_files()' to allow you to pass in a
      list of mixed-type files (some XML, some Perl) and have them be
      parsed properly.

      - Add documentation about implementing your own configuration reader

  Workflow::Config::Perl

      - New class: code moved from Workflow::Config for perl-only parsing

  Workflow::Config::XML

      - New class: code moved from Workflow::Config for XML-only parsing

  Workflow::Factory

      - Invoke class method in Workflow::Config to deal with
      potentially different types of configuration (e.g., mixing and
      matching 'xml' and 'perl' files).

  Workflow::Persister::DBI::AutoGeneratedId:

      - Fix typo bug spotted by Martin Winkler (winkler-martin@web.de)

      * Applied modified patches from Jim Smith (jgsmith@tamu.edu) to
        do the following:

      - Allow you to read in the XML/Perl configuration file from
      somewhere else and pass it to Workflow::Config as a scalar
      reference.

      - You can subclass Workflow::Factory and still use 'FACTORY' to
      import the factory of the class you want and 'instance()' to do
      the same.

      * Added docs for these new features, and added tests for at
        least the factory subclassing feature.
