INTRO
========================================

The 'Workflow' Perl module implements a standalone workflow system. It
aims to be simple but flexible and therefore powerful. Each piece of
the workflow system has a direct and easily stated job, and hopefully
you'll find that you can put the pieces together to create very useful
systems.

Read 'perldoc Workflow' for a more detailed introduction, sample usage,
interactions with your applications, and more.


INSTALLATION
========================================

To install this module type one of the following:

 perl Makefile.PL  or   perl Build.PL
 make                   ./Build
 make test              ./Build test
 make install           ./Build install


QUICK START
========================================

The eg/ticket/ directory contains a configured workflow system. You
can access the same data and logic in two ways:

  * a command-line application (ticket.pl)
  * a CGI script               (ticket.cgi)
  * a web application          (ticket_web.pl)

To initialize:

 perl ticket.pl --db

To run the command-line application:

 perl ticket.pl

To access the database and data from CGI, add the relevant
configuration for your web server and call ticket.cgi:

 http://www.mysite.com/workflow/ticket.cgi

To start up the standalone web server:

 perl ticket_web.pl

(Barring changes to HTTP::Daemon and forking the standalone server
won't work on Win32; use CGI instead, although patches are always
welcome.)

For more info, see 'eg/ticket/README'
